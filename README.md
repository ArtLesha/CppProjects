# C++ projects

### Hey, these are my projects written in C++ language, with which I want to demonstrate my knowledge and skills as a developer.
 During the design of these programs, basic and advanced language concepts, object-oriented programming, some features of modern standards (C++11, C++14 and C++17) and STL were used. A more precise description of each program is given below and full documentation is contained in the projects source files. *Makefiles are written for g++ compiler in Windows style*.
 
 ***Adventure text game:*** an ordinary adventure RPG-like text game. There is a Player who starts the game at level 1 with the default set of attributes. Player will meet Monsters that can be either a slime, an orc or a dragon. He can choose to run away or fight them. Fight is turn-based. If Player wins the fight, he will level up, get Monster's gold and attributes will be increased. The goal of the game is to reach level 10 with the most amount of gold.

 ***Array container class:*** a self-written dynamic, resizable array container class with all common functionalities implemented using class template.

 ***Basic calculator:*** a program with calculator functionality that operates on two integer numbers inputted by user with 4 basic arithmetic operations implemented using function pointers
 
 ***Blackjack:*** a common blackjack game. Program consists of 2 classes: Card and Deck. Card class is a common Card with it's own Rank and Suit. Deck represents array of 52 Cards each with different set of Suit and Rank. Deck gets filled with the Cards at the start of the game and shuffled by swapping each Card with another random Card in the Deck.
 
 ***Decimal to binary:*** a program that converts decimal number into binary using recursion. Also includes some manipulations with the output stream for a better perception of the binary number.
 
 ***Fixed point number container class:*** a self-written container class for fixed point number with 2 digits after decimal.
 
 ***Higher-lower:*** basic "Higher or Lower" guessing game.
 
 ***Sorting algorithms:*** a program that performs sorting of arrays using selection or bubble sort including user-defined comparison, function pointers and template functions.
